# TCP Server/Client Application
A basic project I made showcasing the knowledge and ability to create basic TCP servers in Java that can send and verify hash data.

You can run the TCPServer on one computer and the TCPClient on another; TCPServer will spin up on a specific port and wait, while client will ask for a local/private IP and a file path. The file's hash data will then be sent to the waiting server, the hash will be verified, and a success message will display if the operation was successful, along with stats about the file size, time taken, and throughput. 

This project represents network file transfer, data integrity verification, network performance measurement, and a simple client-server model.
